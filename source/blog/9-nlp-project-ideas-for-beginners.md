Example
NLP projects, Document Clustering
NLP projects, MWSD example
Multiple-writing-style-detector is one great example of document clustering that only uses Python. This algorithm aims to detect different writing styles in a text, then group or cluster them together. It’s particularly useful when working with large documents and data sets.

Real-World Applications
Document clustering is a great way to organize and analyze large amounts of data. Document clustering can be used for everything from helping you find relevant documents for research to creating searchable archives of your company’s past.

For example, let’s say you’re working on an advanced project that involves collecting, organizing, and analyzing data from many different sources. You could use document clustering to help you manage all of that information so that it’s easy to find exactly what you need when you need it.

You could also use document clustering to archive your company’s history. Document clustering allows you to categorize large amounts of text into themes based on their meaning and content so that they are easier to find later. This can be extremely useful in helping your company maintain its historical record.

Next Word Prediction
Next-word prediction is a feature that predicts the next word you will type. It’s designed to help you type faster and more accurately by suggesting words as you type them.

Example
NLP projects, Next Word Prediction
BERT is a next-word prediction NLP project developed by Nandan Pandey, created using Pytorch and Streamlit. It uses word representations learned from large amounts of unlabeled data.

The goal of BERT is to predict the next word given an input sentence. This goal can be achieved by predicting the words in all possible positions of the sentence and choosing the most likely sequence of words to use as a prediction.

Real-World Applications
Next-word prediction is an excellent tool for people who want to become more efficient and productive. It can help you save time by predicting words as you type, which saves you the effort of having to type them out.

For example, if you’re writing an email, next-word prediction can help you create a message more quickly and accurately by guessing what word you will use next. In the same vein, if you’re working with spreadsheets or other documents that require numbers in a specific order (such as lists), the next-word prediction will save time by making sure everything is spelled correctly without requiring any extra effort on your part.

Text Summarization
Text summarization is the process of taking a long text and reducing it to a shorter version that accurately represents the original. This can be done by many different methods, including keyword extraction and machine learning.

Example
NLP projects, Text Summarization
This text-summarization NLP project by Praveen Dubey has been created to summarize large amounts of text. It’s beneficial for academic and scientific papers.

The goal was to create an algorithm that can automatically summarize a document so that it can be easily understood by people who need to become more familiar with the topic. The algorithm also ensures that it does not distort the meaning of the original source text, which is often essential for academic and scientific documents.

Real-World Applications
Text summarization is a handy tool in the real world. It allows people to get a sense of a piece of writing quickly and then go back and read it in full if they have time. This can be helpful for people with a lot of reading to do but not enough time to do it.

The applications of automatic text summarization are endless: from news organizations that want to give readers a quick summary of their stories to businesses that want to quickly summarize their own products’ user manuals.

Question Answering
Question answering is an NLP task involving answers to questions about a given text. It’s a valuable way to measure how well NLP algorithms can understand natural language, and it’s also helpful in training them to make better predictions.

Example
NLP projects, Question Answering
Question-Answering-System-NLP (QA NLP) is a question-and-answer-based project written in Python. The tools used include Apache Solr, the NLTK library, and the Spacy library. The algorithm performs large-scale searches on given data, then analyzes the text in different ways, such as sentiment or word analysis.

Real-World Applications
One application of question-answering is in customer service. When customers ask questions about your product or service, you can automate their answers by using QA NLP. Another application of question-answering is in customer research. If someone asks you, “What color dress should I wear to my friend’s wedding?” you could use QA NLP to find out what colors are popular for weddings this year so that you can give them some suggestions. A third application for QA NLP is chatbots and voice assistants.

Property Price Prediction
Property price prediction is the process of using natural language processing to predict the future price of a given property. The goal is to determine what factors affect the price of a given property and how much it will cost to purchase or rent.

Example
NLP projects, Property Price Prediction
LilHomie is a housing price prediction project by Vivek Pandey. It generates housing appraisals and determines a property’s value in New York. This project has been created with Jupyter Notebook and Python.

Real-World Applications
Property price description has a variety of applications in the real world and is one of the most useful ways to describe property prices. Property price prediction is used by real estate agents to help clients determine whether or not a property is within their budget. Real estate agents can also use property price descriptions to determine whether or not a home has been overpriced.

Insurance companies also use property price predictions to determine how much they should charge homeowners for their policies. Finally, property price predictions can be used as part of an appraisal report when determining what properties are worth on the open market.

Text Games
Text-based games are a type of game that focuses on the input of the player to progress through the story. The gameplay relies not on graphics but on the player’s ability to solve problems with simple prompts.

Example
NLP projects, Text Games
One of the best text-based NLP projects is AI Dungeon. It is a text adventure game that uses AI to come up with open-ended storylines. The game was developed using Python and NLP, combining the two to create an engaging player experience.

Real-World Applications
