## 2022 年，Github 上排名前 10 的最高 Python 框架

[^1]: Django is an open-source framework that enables programmers to develop apps and websites of different complexity within a short period of time. Django offers several advantages like reusability of components, less code, low coupling, and a principle of not repeating. Most importantly, this is one of the easiest Python frameworks, hence, it is most suitable for beginners.
[^6]: Pyramid is Python’s open-source framework that runs on Python 3 and intends to achieve accurate results without unexpected complications. The best of the Pyramid feature that Python provides is its capacity to run, both in small and large applications. The framework also offers a functioning network that is consistently adding to improve the structure.
[^11]: Falcon is a micro framework that will allow developers to create small applications, app backends, and high-level frameworks. Experts say falcon is not appropriate for serving HTML pages, but it is adept for those who use the RESTful APIs conception.

Hug
Hug is a fast micro-framework designed to build APIs. it provides developers with various API versions, automatic documentation, and annotation-powered validation. Besides, its compilation from Cython has enhanced the framework’s performance capability.

Web2py
Web2py is an adaptable, open-source, full-stack Python framework that accompanies its online IDE that incorporates a code supervisor, debugger, and a single tick stationing feature. The framework is also an exceptional information handling tool that permits developers to create drafts and dynamic web content in Python.

Tornado
Quite similar to Flask, Tornado also possesses basic features and an asynchronous library. Tornado is quite different from other Python frameworks since it is not based on WSGI. It supports Linux and BSD OS and is quite appropriate to develop simple applications.

Cherrypy
Cherrypy is an object-oriented Python framework that is a huge fan of the minimalistic approach. Applications that are developed through this framework are independent Python applications that possess its specially implanted multi-strung web server.

Aiohttp
It combines the functions of a server and the clients’ web frameworks to provide customers with a WebSocket and a client-server. Aiohttp is an asynchronous web framework that applies Python’s 3.5+ features. It also offers various async drivers and wrapping objects for popular databases such as PostgreSQL, and MySQL, to name a few.

Sanic
Sanic is a non-synchronous framework based on the uvloop. It is a basic Python structure developed to offer quick HTTP responses. Sanic is also one of the most favored non-synchronous frameworks by engineers since it permits several types of logging, contains module backing, and supports outlines for sub-steering inside an application.

Growler
Growler is a microframework that is relatively less popular compared to other Python-based frameworks. It is single-threaded and partially implemented. Growler’s custom chain in its middleware provides an easy way to deploy complex applications.
